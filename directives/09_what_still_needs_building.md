# Directive: What Still Needs Building

This document lists features that are partially built, not yet built, or need improvement. Work through these in order of priority.

---

## Priority 1 — Core Platform Gaps

### 1.1 Student Quizzes (not yet API-driven)
- `pendingQuizzes` and `completedQuizzes` arrays are always empty
- No `quizzes` table in the DB schema
- **To build:** Add `quizzes` and `quiz_attempts` tables, add to student sync endpoint, populate in `student-dashboard.js`

### 1.2 Student Certificates (not yet API-driven)
- `CERTIFICATES` array is always empty
- No `certificates` table in the DB schema
- **To build:** Add `certificates` table (awarded when course completed), add to student sync endpoint

### 1.3 Course Enrolment Flow
- Students can be created with a `course` field but no `enrolments` record is created
- The student dashboard courses tab will always be empty until enrolments are created
- **To build:** When onboarding a student, also insert into `enrolments` table with `student_id`, `course_id`, `tutor_id`, `start_date`, `total_lessons`

### 1.4 Lesson Tracking
- `COURSES` progress is always 0% — no lesson completion tracking
- **To build:** Add `lesson_completions` table, update progress when tutor submits class report

---

## Priority 2 — Payments

### 2.1 Stripe Integration
- Payment links are generated manually (stored in localStorage)
- No Stripe webhook handler to confirm payments
- **To build:** Implement `POST /api/payments/webhook` for Stripe, update `payments` table on success, add credits to student

### 2.2 Payment Links in DB
- Currently stored in `localStorage.sn_payment_links`
- **To build:** Add `payment_links` table, store/retrieve from DB

---

## Priority 3 — Operations

### 3.1 Late Join API
- Late joins are logged via `POST /api/sync/late-joins`
- The operations dashboard reads from `GET /api/sync/dashboard/operations`
- **Status:** Backend complete, frontend needs verification

### 3.2 Absent Teacher Notifications
- Auto-absent watcher marks booking as `teacher_absent` in-memory
- **To build:** Call `PUT /api/bookings/:id/status` with `status: 'teacher_absent'` to persist to DB

---

## Priority 4 — HR

### 4.1 Job Applications
- Applications from `teach-with-us.html` form go to `POST /api/applications`
- HR dashboard reads from `GET /api/sync/dashboard/hr`
- **Status:** Appears complete — verify end-to-end

---

## Priority 5 — Blog

### 5.1 Blog System
- Backend: `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/blogs` — complete
- Frontend: `blog.js`, `blog-post.js`, `admin-blog.js` — connected to API
- **Status:** Complete — verify blog posts can be created from admin

---

## Priority 6 — Quality of Life

### 6.1 Mobile Responsiveness
- Most dashboards are not mobile-optimised
- The public pages (homepage, courses, free-trial) are responsive

### 6.2 Email — PENDING FIX (Zoho SMTP not available on free plan)
- **Status:** ⚠️ Blocked — Zoho free plan does not support SMTP
- **Current behaviour:** Emails are simulated (logged but not sent). AWS SES is configured but in sandbox mode (can only send to verified addresses).
- **Options to fix:**
  1. **Resend.com** (recommended) — free tier 3,000 emails/month, no sandbox, 5-min setup. Sign up at https://resend.com, verify domain `stemnestacademy.co.uk`, get API key, update `emailService.js`
  2. **Upgrade Zoho Mail** to paid plan (~£1/month) — enables SMTP on port 465
  3. **Re-apply for AWS SES production access** with stronger justification
- **When ready:** Tell the developer "fix email" and implement Resend.com integration in `backend/src/services/emailService.js`
- **Impact:** Password reset emails, welcome emails, and demo confirmation emails are not being delivered to real users

### 6.3 Password Change for Students/Tutors
- `PUT /api/users/:id/password` endpoint exists
- No UI for it in student or tutor dashboard
- **To build:** Add "Change Password" section to profile modal

### 6.4 Tutor Availability Sync to DB
- Tutor availability is stored in `localStorage.sn_tutor_avail_<staffId>`
- Should be stored in `tutor_availability` table in DB
- **To build:** On availability save, also call `POST /api/tutor-availability` to persist

### 6.5 Sales Dashboard
- `sales-dashboard.js` — verify it loads pipeline from API correctly
- Should use `GET /api/sync/dashboard/sales`

### 6.6 Quizzes & Assignments — Recommended Approach
See `10_quizzes_and_assignments.md` for the full design.
